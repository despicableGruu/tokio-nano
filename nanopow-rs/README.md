# Nanopow-rs

Small Rust library to generate proof of work for the Nano cryptocurrency. Fully parallelized on the CPU. The goal is for this to be easily includable in web applications using WASM and stdweb. Currently, it works best as a native POW generation tool in Rust projects as well as in Node.js using [nanopow-rs-node](https://github.com/nanopow-rs-node).
