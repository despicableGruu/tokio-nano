# Nano-rs
Nano-rs is a pure Rust implementation of the Nano cryptocurrency based on Tokio. It is currently in its very infancy. This repo serves as a monorepo that contains several crates, including the root `nano-rs` crate, which is the node implementation itself. There is also `nanopow-rs` which is a standalone Proof of Work implementation and `nano-lib` which provides functions for working with the Nano protocol in Rust.
